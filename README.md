# MechaniConnect

MechaniConnect is a mobile application designed to connect users experiencing vehicle issues with nearby mechanics. The app caters to two main user roles - mechanics and users with vehicles.

## Features

- **User Request:** When a user faces car troubles while driving, they can use MechaniConnect to send a service request to the nearest available mechanics.
- **Issue Description:** Users can provide a detailed description of the car issue, helping mechanics understand the problem before accepting the request.

- **Location Sharing:** The app allows users to share their current location with mechanics, ensuring quick and efficient assistance.

- **Mechanic Response:** Mechanics receive service requests, view the user's location, and can choose to accept or decline the job based on their availability.
